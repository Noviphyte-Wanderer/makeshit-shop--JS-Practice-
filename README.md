# First project on Github: Makeup Shop Project
## First made in April-May 2025

The projects contains 2 main sections:

1. A cart that contains the list of items bought and the bill associated with the cart can be shown by pressing the cart button above the navigation.
2. A catalog of items that the user can purchase.

There are several main functions in the page:

* The ability to buy items, including a prompt to accomodate for accidental purchases.
* The ability to cancel out of the prompt without buying anything.
* The ability to choose how many of the item you want to buy.
* The ability to clear all items from your cart, which puts all items back into the item stock.
  * The item numbers in the catalog will accomodate for this, ensuring all cleared items are back in the "shelves".
